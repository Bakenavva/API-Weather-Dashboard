## Description
This is a TypeScript OOP project that uses OpenWeatherAPI to serve live weather data to the user, based on their requested inputs, and populates a database. The database can be manipulated by means of adding & removing cities that populate it. The data provided is a 5 calendar day forecast that shows data for Temperature, Wind Speed, & Humidity (and an icon for the weather on that day).
